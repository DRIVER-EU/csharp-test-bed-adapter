# csharp-test-bed-adapter

This is the C# Apache Kafka adapter created for the DRIVER-EU [test-bed](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/test-bed). This allows C# written programs to communicate over the test-bed.

The implementation is a wrapper around [Confluent's .NET Client for Apache Kafka<sup>TM</sup>](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet) with the additional NuGet package to support Avro serialization ([Confluent.Kafka.Avro (version 0.11.6)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/confluent.kafka.avro)), and offers support for:

* Sending and receiving Avro schema's and messages: both producer and consumer use Avro schema's for their message key and value.
Methods for sending and receiving standard or custom messages are `SendMessage` & `AddCallback`
* Logging via Kafka: your application can log on several log levels (eg. error, debug, info) onto a specific test-bed topic.
Methods for sending and receiving log messages are `Log` & `AddLogCallback`
* Receive time information: the adapter is connected to the [test-bed time service](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/test-bed-time-service), allowing you to receive relevant time-related information like fictive trial time, or the speed of the trial.
Method for retrieving the time information is `GetTimeInfo`
* Uploading large data: the adapter is connected to the [test-bed large data service](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/large-file-service), allowing you to upload large data files for sharing with other applications connected to the test-bed.
Methods for uploading large data are `GetLargeFileServiceClient` & `Upload`
* Setup a SSL connection with a [test-bed including security features](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/test-bed/tree/master/docker/local%2Bsecurity)
Setup is completely done in the `CSharpTestBedAdapter-settings.xml`
* Internal Management: the adapter makes the coupling between application and test-bed as easy as possible.

## Project structure

This project contains one `CSharpTestBedAdapter.sln` solution, which in its turn contains 7 C# projects:

### src\CSharpTestBedAdapter

The main C# project outputting a class library `CSharpTestBedAdapter.dll` that you can use to create Kafka producers and consumers connecting to the DRIVER-EU test-bed.

### examples\CSharpExampleProducer (Custom & Standard)

The examples for setting up and using a producer via the `CSharpTestBedAdapter.dll`.
`CSharpExampleProducerCustom` sends out a test message that is defined in `example\common\CommonMessages`.
`CSharpExampleProducerStandard` sends out a [Common Alerting Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol) (CAP) message that is defined in `example\common\StandardMessages`.

### examples\CSharpExampleConsumer

The example for setting up and using a consumer via the `CSharpTestBedAdapter.dll`.
This example listens to both the test messages from `CSharpExampleProducerCustom` and CAP messages from `CSharpExampleProducerStandard`.

### src\CommonMessages

Project that is used in the examples only, containing a simple test Avro schema that is used for transmitting messages of that type from producer to consumer.
Inside the [examples\common\CommonMessages\data](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/csharp-test-bed-adapter/tree/master/examples/common/CommonMessages/data) folder you'll find a README regarding the conversion from Avro schema to C# class file(s).

### src\CoreMessages

The code project that bundles all system/core message formats defined for the DRIVER-EU Test-bed. These schemas can also be found at [DRIVER-EU avro-schemas](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/avro-schemas/tree/master/core). This project is required for `CSharpTestBedAdapter` to run. The following message formats are currently implemented:

* Heartbeat: sending to topic `system_heartbeat`
This allows the adapter to indicate it is still alive for all other adapters in the test-bed.
* Log: sending to topic `system_logging`
Both the adapter as your application can send log messages to the test-bed to inform operators on what is going on inside the application.
* Admin heartbeat: receiving from topic `system_admin_heartbeat`
The adapter checks if the admin tool inside the test-bed is alive. If not during the first 10 seconds of this adapters existence, the adapter will enter `DEBUG` mode. If the admin tool was present but connection is lost somehow, the adapter will enter `DISABLED` mode until the admin tool comes back alive, re-sending and re-receiving all messages that were queued during being disabled.
* Timing: receiving from topic `system_timing`
The [time service](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/test-bed-time-service) updates all adapters for setting a global time frame. Current time information can be retrieved from the `GetTimeInfo` method.
* Time control: receiving from topic `system_timing_control`
The [Trial Management Tool](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/scenario-manager) notifies all adapters on time changes, for instance whenever a running trial is paused.

### src\StandardMessages

The code project that bundles all standard message formats defined for the Common Information Space (CIS) of the DRIVER-EU Test-bed. All these Avro schemas can be found at [DRIVER-EU avro-schemas](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/avro-schemas/tree/master/standard). This project is required for `CSharpTestBedAdapter` to run. The following message formats are currently implemented:

* [Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol)
* [Emergency Management Shared Information (EMSI)](https://www.iso.org/standard/57384.html)
* [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON)
* [Mobile Location Protocol (MLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Location_Protocol)
* [Test-bed large data update messages](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/avro-schemas/tree/master/core/large-data)

### src\SimMessages

The code project that bundles all simulation message formats defined for the Common Simulation Space (CSS) of the DRIVER-EU Test-bed. All these Avro schemas can be found at [DRIVER-EU avro-schemas](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/avro-schemas/tree/master/sim). This project is not required for `CSharpTestBedAdapter` to run.

### Dependencies

* All projects are build on the .NET Framework 4.6
* All projects are dependent on one NuGet package from Confluent:
  * pre-released [Confluent.Kafka.Avro 0.11.6](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Confluent.Kafka.Avro/0.11.6)

In order to use the `csharp-test-bed-adapter`, you are also required to download and install the above-mentioned NuGet package.
 
## Usage

The C# test-bed adapter is available as [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CSharpTestBedAdapter/).
You can also manually build `CSharpTestBedAdapter` and include the compiled DLLs `CSharpTestBedAdapter.dll`, `CoreMessages.dll` & `StandardMessages.dll` into your own application.

Next to the compiled `CSharpTestBedAdapter.dll`, there is a [CSharpTestBedAdapter-settings.xml](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/csharp-test-bed-adapter/blob/release/trial_4/src/CSharpTestBedAdapter/CSharpTestBedAdapter-settings.xml), where you can change the following adapter settings:
* __client.id__: the name of the application that uses this adapter
* __heartbeat.interval__: the time (in ms) between sending a heartbeat
* __security.protocol__: the security protocol this adapter is using (PLAINTEXT or SSL)
* __security.ca.path__: the path of the issuer certificate :: only needed when `security.protocol = SSL`
* __security.keystore.path__: the path of the PKCS#12 keystore (client keypair + certificate) for client authentication :: only needed when `security.protocol = SSL`
* __security.keystore.password__: the password for the PKCS#12 keystore :: only needed when `security.protocol = SSL`
* __broker.url__: the URL of the Kafka broker to connect to
* __schema.url__: the URL of the schema registry service to use
* __send.sync__: indication if the adapter needs to stall the application thread until the message is sent
* __retry.count__: number of retries before timing out when sending messages
* __retry.time__: amount of time (in ms) before timing out when sending messages
* __direct.connect__: indication if this adapter is allowed to send and receive messages without waiting for the admin tool

See the 3 example projects for further implementation of this adapter.

## Security

With regards to the security aspect of this adapter, the __security.ca.path__ property must contain a .pem file. This is a text file that contains the concatenated PEM-encoded Certificate Authority (CA) certificate(s) in your adapterâ€™s complete certificate chain. Bear in mind that for this to work properly it is containing the complete chain of the CA:
* if your certificate is issued by a Root CA, then this .pem file should contain only the Root CA certificate
* if your certificate is issued by an Intermediate CA, which is issued by a Root CA (this is currently the case within the DRIVER+ Test-bed), then this .pem file should contain the Root CA certificate and the Intermediate CA certificate

For more information on security within the DRIVER+ Test-bed, please the (this repository)[https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/test-bed-security-authorization-service].

## Data conversion between Avro and C#

This functionality ensures proper conversion from Avro schemas to C# classes. It uses the `avrogen.exe` that is built from the [Apache Avro GitHub](https://github.com/apache/avro).

## Core, Standard & Sim Avro schemas

Within this adapter, all core, standard and sim Avro schemas defined in the [DRIVER-EU avro-schemas](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/avro-schemas) repository are already converted for ease of use. If you want to re-convert these schemas, you can run the `convert.bat` Windows batch file in the folder `src\CoreMessages\data\avro-schemas` for the core adapter messages, `src\StandardMessages\data\avro-schemas` for the standard messages, and `src\SimMessages\data\avro-schemas` for the simulation messages.

## Conversion of custom schemas

Conversion from Avro schema to C# class file requires the following files, which can be found at `src\CoreMessages\data\avro-schemas` or `src\StandardMessages\data\avro-schemas`:

* The compiled `avrogen.exe` ([source](https://github.com/apache/avro/tree/master/lang/csharp/src/apache/codegen)) and its required DLLs
* The Windows batch file `convert.bat` that calls the `avrogen.exe` with the correct parameters for converting all present Avro schemas to corresponding C# class file(s). You can edit this batch file to convert your own Avro schemas.
